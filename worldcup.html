<h4><p>The World Cup is happens every four years in which teams around the world come to compet to try to win the World Cup trophy. The World Cup features 32 national teams.
There are two stages in the month of the World Cup. The groups are 2 "Group Stage" and "Knockout Stage".In the first stage (the "Group Stage"), the 32 teams are placed into 
  eight groups of four teams each. Each group consists of one "seeded" team based on FIFA Rankings and recent World Cups, and the other teams in each group are selected at 
  random from the top finishers in qualifying play and the host team. Groups are set up so that no group contains more than two European teams or more than one team from any 
  of the 5 other FIFA zones (there are six FIFA continental zones; Africa, Asia, North and Central America and Caribbean, South America, Oceania and Europe). Each group plays
  a round-robin tournament, guaranteeing that every team will play at least three matches. The last round of matches of each group is held simultaneously to prevent collusion
  between nations. Three points are awarded for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss. The top two teams from each group advance to the second stage (the 'Knockout Stage'). 
  If two or more teams finish even on points, tie-breakers are used: the first is 'goal differential' then total goals scored, then head-to-head results, and finally drawing of lots. 
  In the Group Phase, games may end in a draw. The second round, or "Knockout Stage," is a single-elimination round in which teams play each other, and there are no draws; extra time 
  and penalty kicks are used to decide the winner. The "Knockout Stage" begins with the "Round of 16" in which the winner of each Group plays against the runner-up from another group. 
  This is followed by quarter-finals, semi-finals and a final. The losing semi-finalists play a match for third place.</p></h4>
